# Happy-Numbers

A self-improving program to test for happy numbers.

A happy numbers is any positive integer, for which replacing the number by the sum of the squares of its digits in base-ten, and repeating the process, as many times as are necessary, yields 1. 

The "self-improvement" comes in tearms of the program checking the input provided against two ever growing lists of numbers, and then updating the appropriate list according to whether or not the input is happy.
